Introduction\r\n\r\nIn layman’s language, remote recognizing is the checking of Earth by satel-\r\nlite or high-flying workmanship so as to get data concerning it. It’s essentially\r\nthe investigation of getting data concerning articles or zones from a detachment,\r\nsometimes from claim to fame or satellites.\r\n\r\nRemote sensors collect learning by examination of the criticalness that is\r\nreflected from the planet. These sensors are on the satellites or mounted on the\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\nRemote sensors are either inactive or dynamic. Standoffish sensors answer to\r\nouter redesigns. They record standard centrality that is reflected or discharged\r\nfrom the Earth’s surface. The essential ordinary supply of radiation perceived\r\nby inert sensors is reflected in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nIn a refinement, dynamic sensors utilize inward upgrades to gather getting\r\nthe hang of concerning Earth. For instance, an optical contraption shaft remote\r\ndistinctive structure comes a laser onto the outside of Earth and measures the\r\ntime that it takes for the laser to reflect back to its perceiving part.\r\n\r\n![Figure 1](Images/pic1.png)\r\n\r\n## 2. Application of Remote Sensing\r\n\r\n<b>Coastal applications:</b> Screen bound changes, track dregs transport guide\r\nwaterfront alternatives. This information is utilized for the seaside mapping\r\nand disintegration block.\r\n\r\n<b>Ocean applications:</b> Screen sea dissemination and the ebb and flow frame-\r\nworks, live sea temperature and wave statures and track sea ice. This learning\r\nis won’t to higher see the seas and the best approach to best oversee sea assets.\r\n\r\n<b>Hazard applications:</b> Tack hurricanes, earthquakes, erosion and flooding.\r\nThis knowledge is wont to assess the impacts of natural disaster and make readi-\r\nness ways to be used before and once a venturous event.\r\n\r\n<b>Natural resource management:</b> Monitor land use, map wetlands, and\r\noutline life circumstances. This information is wont to limit the insidiousness\r\nthat urban improvement has on the setting and bolster pick the most ideal ap-\r\nproach to manage the guarantee run of the mill assets.\r\n\r\n## 3. Formats Of This Hyperspectral Image\r\n\r\nMultiband image data are represented by a combination of spatial position\r\n(pixel number and line number) and band. The data format for remote sensing\r\nimages is classified into the following three types:\r\n\r\n**BSQ:** Band SeQuential image data (pixel number and line number) of each band\r\nare separately stored.\r\n\r\n**BIL:** Band Interleaved by Line data are arranged in the order of band number\r\nand repeated with respect to the line number.\r\n\r\n**BIP:** Band Interleaved by Pixel data with respect to each pixel arranged spa-\r\ntially by pixel number and line number.\r\n\r\nFor shading picture yield, BSQ organization would be helpful on the grounds\r\nthat three groups will be doled out to R, G and B. Anyway BIP arrangement\r\nwould be better for characterization by most extreme probability classifier in\r\nlight of the fact that multi-band information are required pixel by pixel for the\r\nmulti-variable handling. BIL would be a trade off among BSQ and BIP.\r\n\r\nRemote detecting data some of the time incorporates various explanation\r\ninformation also to picture information. So the satellite picture information\r\nhave been given in a standard organization called World Standard Format (as\r\na rule utilizes BSQ or BIL format), or LTWG position (indicated via Landsat\r\nTechnical Working Group).\r\n\r\n## 4. Reflectance Value of Hyperspectral Images\r\n\r\nEach non-living or living body reflects also ingests transmissions by numer-\r\nous sources. Presently the satellites transmit flag which is pondered by items\r\nEarth. Each material assimilates an alternate measure of transmissions and re-\r\nflects an alternate measure of transmissions.\r\n\r\nThe reflected flag figures out which object is there and stores the reflectance\r\nesteems. There are 425 groups which store distinctive snippets of data of a\r\npixel and has diverse reflectance esteems for various wavelengths. By plotting\r\nof reflectance esteems versus wavelengths chart we can realize which object it is\r\nand furthermore the qualities of that object.\r\n\r\n![Figure 2](Images/pic2.png)\r\n\r\n## 5. Classification of Reflectance Values\r\n\r\nThe classification of the objects can be done on the basis of wavelengths.\r\nFew examples are given below.\r\n\r\n**Vegetation:** Chlorophyll being green acclimatizes light at wavelength around 0.45m\r\n(blue) and 0.67m (red) and reflect immovably in green light, in this man-\r\nner our eyes see strong vegetation as green. Strong plants have a high\r\nreflectance in close infrared some place in the scope of 0.7m and 1.3m.\r\nThis is fundamentally a result of the inside structure of plant leaves. As\r\nthe inside structure of leaves varies from plant to plant. This urges us to\r\nunderstand which plant is there.\r\n\r\n**Water:** In the liquid state, water has commonly low reflectance, with clear wa-\r\nter having the best reflectance in the blue portion of the unmistakable\r\npiece of the range. Water has high absorption and no reflectance in the\r\nnearby infrared wavelengths extend.Turbid water has high reflectance in\r\nevident district than clear water. This is moreover substantial for wa-\r\nters containing vegetation. Ice and snow all things considered have high\r\nreflectance over each perceptible wavelength. Reflectance reduces in the\r\nnearby infrared section and there is low reflectance in shortwave infrared.\r\n\r\n**Soil:** Exposed soil, for the most part, has to expand reflectance, with more\r\nnoteworthy reflectance in close infrared and shortwave infrared. A few\r\nvariables influencing the reflectance are:\r\n\r\n- **Moisture Content**\r\n\r\n- **Soil Texture**\r\n\r\n- **Surface Roughness**\r\n\r\n- **Presence of FeO 2 and Fe 2 O 3**\r\n\r\n- **Moisture Content**\r\n\r\n## 6. GUI Usage\r\n\r\nThe GUI, presented above is made in python using Tkinter library. This\r\nlibrary contains functions like Button, Menu, Canvas, Frame, etcetera. I also\r\nused classes like filedialog. This class contains functions used to open a dialog\r\nbox to navigate hrough computer drives and select the file.\r\n\r\nHere I first created a frame in which we will be making other features like\r\nbuttons or menu or even loading the photo. After that I created a navigation\r\nmenu bar which contains options like File and Edit which contains options like:\r\n\r\n- **File: ”Open”, ”Save”, ”Exit”**\r\n\r\n- **Edit: ”Bands”**\r\n\r\n- **Quit: ”Quit”**\r\n\r\n#### 6.1 File\r\n\r\nThe Open option will open a dialog box which will be used to select the\r\n.ENVI file which then will be used to load the hyperspectral image. The Save\r\noption will save the current modified image as .ENVI file or any other as per\r\nusers choice. The Exit option will close the window and the program will shut\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe Open option opens a dialog box and allows us to select the image to\r\nopen. For this I used the spectral library of python from which I used io class\r\nand envi function.\r\n\r\n#### 6.2 Edit\r\n\r\nThe ”Edit” menu contains ”Bands” option which will open a window in\r\nwhich the user have to enter 3 values i.e the bands which will show the image\r\nin having the entered bands.\r\n\r\n#### 6.3 Graph\r\n\r\nThe graph in one the image above is created by Spectral library. This\r\nlibrary has an in-built function that will show the graph of reflectance values\r\nvs wavelength. This graph gives us the information of the object present in the\r\npixel selected.\r\n\r\n#### 6.4 Preprocessing\r\n\r\nThe bands having negative values are not used and so we need to remove it.\r\nFor that I used a library called Hyspeclib. This library gives eigenvavlues and\r\nminimum and maximum reflectance values so that we can remove the negative\r\nvalues. Usually the negative values are -9999 and so it is easy to know them\r\nand remove them.\r\n\r\nAfter their removal, the image is saved in two parts where the original image\r\nis stored and then the saved image is opened. This image does not contain\r\nreflectance values that are negative.\r\n\r\n## 7.
